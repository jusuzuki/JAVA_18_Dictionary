## Description

We ask the user for a word. The word is stored as an object. The user can then add definitions to each word.
Definitions are also stored as objects. The homepage lists both words and definitions.
This is an exercise in working with objects within objects in Java, as well as managing 'post' and 'get' methods.

## Setup

* Run project with Gradle and open on http://localhost:4567/


## Technologies Used

* JAVA and Spark Framework
* Tested using FluentLenium Framework
* Templates generated with Apache Velocity Engine
* HTML/CSS/Boostrap
